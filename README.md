### Under the Hood: <a name="under"></a> <br>

<details>
<summary>App</summary>

* App stored the majority of our functionality.  It held the searchForMovie() function as well as the filterMovies() function.  We ran fetch requests in their own separate files, and called them on componentDidMount() during page load.
 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Modal</summary>

* We intended on trying to make a Modal pop over the movie cards similar to the Netflix UI.  However, while learning Router, we quickly realized that in order to maximize our learning using that and Switch, that we would need to ditch it.  

</details>

<details>
<summary>Movies</summary>

* Movies was used to iterate through the movies pulled in our fetch, and pass props into individual Cards.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Card</summary>

* Each card rendered had specific key and information. 

</details><br>

### Challenges: <a name="challenges"></a> <br>

* Andrew: I am still feeling quite burnt out from Mod 2.  There have been some big life changes as well taking place that have made focusing a bit difficult during these past two weeks.

<br>

### Reflections: <a name="reflections"></a> <br>

* 

<br>

### Future Iterations: <a name="future"></a> <br>

* It would be cool to add a login feature and give users the ability to rate movies that they see.

* We would have liked to add movie trailers into the movie previews as well.
